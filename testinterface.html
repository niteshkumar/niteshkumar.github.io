              HackerEarth provides an interface where the developers can take programming tests created by companies. Their programming skills are assessed based on how they perform in these tests. If they score well, they are shortlisted and are invited for further interview process by the companies.
            </p>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              This interface is very crucial because:
            </p>

            <ol class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              <li>It directly affected people’s prospects of getting a job.</li>
              <li>It was an interface for taking tests. Most users had never seen it before. That means that there can be absolutely no learning curve.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Problems with the existing interface</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              Sadly, based on the user feedback, it was clear that the existing was not very user-friendly. Users were having a hard time completing the most basic tasks, like submitting an answer after completion.
            </p>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              Most frequent feedback we got from the users was

            <ul class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              <li>“The interface is clunky.”</li>
              <li>“I forgot to submit my answers.”</li>
              <li>“I wanted to submit my answer but I by mistake I ended the test.”</li>
              <li>“I don’t know which questions I have already attempted. It’s difficult come back to unattempted questions.”</li>

            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Design plan</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              We decided to figure out problems in the existing interface based on user feedback and complaints, and design solutions to mitigate these errors without making any stark changes.
            </p>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              We wanted to solve the usability problems with moving as less pieces as possible. We couldn’t make any drastic changes in the layout or make any big changes that would increase the learning curve.
            </p>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              We set out to improve the overall usability , readability and mitigate user errors with this redesign.
            </p>


            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Redesigning Multiple Choice Quesitons</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              We started from multiple choice questions. This question type was most prone to user errors. It wasn’t clear to users that they had to click the “submit” button after selecting an option.
            </p>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
             Earlier, users had to click exactly on the radio button to select an option and the options were not properly spaced out.
            </p>


            <div class="col-md-12">
                <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/testinterface/old1.png"><img class="story-img" src="images/testinterface/old1.png"></a>
              </div>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              I designed options as blocks. The option-text was enclosed in these boxes and they felt more tactile. Also, proper feedback was designed on hover. This feedback tells the user that the whole block can be selected.
            </p>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              Once you select a block, a message floats right next to the submit button and attracts user’s attention to the “submit” button. Even if the user decides to change his answer, he will remember that he has to submit his answer after selecting it.
            </p>

             <div class="col-md-12">
               <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/testinterface/mcq.mov"><video class="story-img" width="90%" height="auto" align="middle" source="" src="images/testinterface/mcq.mov" type="video/mov" autoplay="" loop=""></video></a>
            </div>

            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Coming back to unattempted questions</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              Earlier, question’s attempted/unattempted state was demonstrated by a dot right next to question number in questions listing. If the dot is grey, it means the question is unattempted. If it’s blue, it means you have already attempted it.
            </p>

            <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
                <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/testinterface/old-attempt.png"><img class="story-img" src="images/testinterface/old-attempt.png"></a>
              </div>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              Candidates taking a test have a habit of leaving some questions for later. They want to attempt other questions and come back to it at a later stage. When there is not much time left for the test to end, the user wouldn’t want to be looking for these dots in front of these questions — if it’s blue or grey. That is exactly what was happening. They were having to search for unattempted questions.
            </p>


            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">The solution</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              I designed a solution which makes it easier to come back to unattempted questions. Whenever you submit your answer for a question, a vertical blue line runs through the question in the list.
            </p>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              The interesting thing is this blue line continues if you attempt the next question and breaks when you skip a question.
            </p>

            <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
              <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/testinterface/new-attempt.png"><img class="story-img" src="images/testinterface/new-attempt.png"></a>
            </div>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              Now imagine, you have 10 minutes left in the test and you want to get back to the unattempted questions. You just have to look where the blue line is breaks. Wherever it breaks, it means that you have not yet attempted that question.
            </p>





























            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Trending Songs</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                This screen, also the homepage of Jukebox shows the top 50 trending songs at all times. And since, it shows trending and not all time top songs, the score of each song (number of clicks) is halved every two days. So, in order for a song to trend for a long time, it has to played over and over otherwise it will move down the list.
            </p>

            <div class="col-md-12 img-wrap">
                <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/jukebox/jb1.png"><img class="story-img" src="images/jukebox/jb1.png"></a>
            </div>
            
            


            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Artists</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
               The artist view in earlier design was just a list of artists in alphabatical order and when you would select a particular artist you would be taken to that artist's page.
            </p>

            <div class="img-wrap col-md-12">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                  <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/jukebox/jb-artist-list.jpg"><img class="story-img" src="images/jukebox/jb-artist-list.jpg"></a>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                  <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/jukebox/jb-artist-page.jpg"><img class="story-img" src="images/jukebox/jb-artist-page.jpg"></a>           
              </div>
              <div class="clear"></div>
            </div>

            <p class="para-gap text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              As the design evolved, we clubbed the two views together as it would save the user the trouble of going back and forth between the two views and make it easier to navigate through artists. 
            </p>


            <div class="col-md-12">
               <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/jukebox/jb2.png"><img class="story-img" src="images/jukebox/jb2.png"></a>
            </div>

            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Albums</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
               The layout of albums in Albums view was kept asthetically the same as that of albums listed in the artist page but with a larger album art because why change something unnecessarily and it would make a lot of code reusable.
            </p>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              We used the same navigation technique with albums as with artists. The alphabatical list of various albums is present on the left and when an album is selected it open on the right.
            </p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
               <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/jukebox/jb3.png"><img class="story-img" src="images/jukebox/jb3.png"></a>
            </div>

            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Song And Album Interactions</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                While designing the new interaction pattern, I started with a single track - what all actions could I do on a single track on Jukebox. Once interations for a single track were setup, they could be easily applied to albums and artists.
            </p>

             <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
               <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/jukebox/jbw3.jpg"><img class="story-img" src="images/jukebox/jbw3.jpg"></a>

            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Losing The Header</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                We got rid of the conventional header at the top. We were using high resolution cover images for artist pages and huge albums arts. As we already had the player fixed at the bottom, having a header at the top made everything appear dwarfed.
            </p>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                If we had a header, it would primariliy serve as the space for the logo, the searchbar and user options.
            </p>

            <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
               <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/jukebox/header.jpg"><img class="story-img" src="images/jukebox/header.jpg"></a>
            </div>

            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Search</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                So, we made a huge tradeoff by losing a conventional, big, simple looking fixed seachbar at the top when we decided to lose the header. Now, the search bar was nowhere to be seen except for a small search icon on the bottom player. 
            </p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
               <a class="fancybox-button" rel="fancybox-button" href="images/jukebox/bottom-bar.png"><img class="story-img" src="images/jukebox/bottom-bar.png"></a>
            </div>

            <p class="para-gap text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                But once you clicked the search icon you got this entire screen for search on which you had to just start typing and it would look for songs, albums and artists. It had to be fast and the user must get the desired result on the quick results window itself.
            </p>

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                As we didn't really have any other input fields on the entire app except for search, we thought,"why not start searching for results whenever the user starts typing"! It would be as simple as thinking. As soon as you think of a song, just start typing it and jukebox will search it for you. No need to reach for search field. And you go back to the previous view by pressing Esc so that you don't have to move from your keyboard.
            </p>

            <div class="col-md-12">

            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                After numerous iterations and taking out as much as we could, this is what made the final cut.
            </p>

            <div class="heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">What I Learned</div>

            <div class="mini-heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Process is just process</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              One process doesn't fit every project. The best process is the the one that suits you and your team. The best tools are the ones you are fastest with. The thing that matters is to hold the vision and to know how to build it. 
            </p>


            <div class="mini-heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Say no to most things</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              Yes, one of the most important things I learned. As you start to get something in shape and it starts to come together, it's very easy to get excited and lose your vision and hence the core value of the product. It's very imporant to make sure that whatever it is that you're building is not trying to do too much. When you started building it, you had that one problem in mind that it would solve. Keep that in vision.
            </p>

            <div class="mini-heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Using the product</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              We wanted to build a product that we ourselves would love to use. And while building a product it's very eary to miss some invisible UX issues. They need to be discovered by using the the product. 
            </p>

            <div class="mini-heading col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Design a lot of stuff and throw a lot of it away</div>
            <p class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              When I started designing jukebox, one day I would throw together something in photoshop and the next day I would think, "This is just stupid! What was I thinking!" and I would throw it way. I would try something else the next day. It's really important to sleep on it. It helps you envision what you want to build and more importantly what you don't want to build.
